## Hint

Add a method

    bool PeopleArrayIsValid(string[] peopleArray)

…that returns true if peopleArray has at least one element and all names in the array is have a length of 2 to 9 letters.

## Extra

1. Just allow the letter a-z, å,ä,ö in the name. Update *PeopleArrayIsValid*.

2. Figure out two more way to validate the name. Update *PeopleArrayIsValid*.

3. Do the validation with *regular expressions*. Update *PeopleArrayIsValid*.
